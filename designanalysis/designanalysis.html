            Each design principle needs three items:
            1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
            2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
            3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

               <p>
               The principle of Proximity is defined as grouping similar elements close to e
               ach other
               so that navigation is easier for the user. 
               </p>
               <p>
               Example: In this image you can see that w3schools follow this principle for their
               overall layout on the front page. The principle can be seen within the menu icon,
               on the top navigation bar, and the buttons are even grouped together.

                  The site is straight forward in its mobile, iPhone X, presentation.
                  Site is vertically oriented for top to bottom display on the phone.
                  It can be consumed horizontally but this does not seem comfortable
                  and requires more scrolling action. There is no side to side
                  scrolling required in the site. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  All items on the vertical display are center justified in the display.
                  On the horizontal display the information has two vertical columns.
                  The left column is for a side navigational list and the right 75%
                  of the display is primary site content.  In the horizontal display
                  some engagement boxes, green ones, are on the left side of the 
                  container, the gray engagement boxes are center aligned.
               </p>
               <p>  
                  Scrolling is top to bottom in the vertical or horizontal site display.
                  No side to side scrolling. 
               </p>
               <p>                  
                  While content is easy to read it is difficult to interact with in some
                  areas simply because you are trying to interact on a detailed working 
                  level, inputting information.  The information input required on the 
                  site is not conducive to voice diction and the mobile keyboard for 
                  this work is painful. 
               </p>
               <p>
                  The layout is well suited for consuming as a reader of the information.  
                  Any non-full-sized keyboard enabled device is not truly suited for 
                  the primary full site experience.

               <p>
                     The W3Schools web site has a repetition scheme in both the
                     shaping of the containers and the color theme. By mere observation
                     we can see the containers are mostly square and rectangular, even
                     in their spacing. This makes it easier to navigate through options
                     as well as form a pattern which help point in the right direction.
                     Also, the green color used for boarders and buttons simplify what
                     would have required thorough investigation to recognize. The same
                     style is used for all the text; simple and formal, which is
                     adequately suited for its instructional purpose.
               </p>
               <p>
                     This image clearly demonstrates the application of repetition
                     in color scheme and font consistency to create emphasis.

                  Is established via the use of the minimalistic color
                  pattern.  Branding color of green is used with contrasting
                  plan white background.  Test on the white field is always
                  black.  White text on all colored engagement boxes regardless
                  box background color.  All engagement boxes are same size
                  and have white text.  Green engagement boxes are used to
                  access “Try it yourself” exercises and navigating through
                  educational materials.  Most, if not all, other engagement
                  boxes are gray.
