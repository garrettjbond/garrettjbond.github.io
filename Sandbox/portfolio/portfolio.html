        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. Hero can be anyone.
            Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring
            as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.
            I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Someone like you. Someone who'll
            rattle the cages. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell
            them the whole thing was your idea.
