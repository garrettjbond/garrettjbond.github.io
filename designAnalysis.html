            Each design principle needs three items:
            1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
            2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
            3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

               <p>
               The principle of Proximity is defined as grouping similar elements close to e
               ach other
               so that navigation is easier for the user. 
                  <br>
               Example: In the above image you can see that w3schools follow this principle for their
               overall layout on the front page, within the menu icon, and on the top navigation bar.

                     The site is straight forward and simplistic. Main nav bar across
                     the top.  Detailed navigations directory on the left side top to
                     bottom with content located in the center and on the right below
                     the main nav bar.

                     Text for navigation list appears to be left justified while that

                     justified.  Try It Yourself Self arears are all left justified

               <p>
                     The W3Schools web site has a repetition scheme in both the
                     shaping of the containers and the color theme. By mere observation
                     we can see the containers are mostly square and rectangular, even
                     in their spacing. This makes it easier to navigate through options
                     as well as form a pattern which help point in the right direction.
                     Also, the green color used for boarders and buttons simplify what
                     would have required thorough investigation to recognize. The same
                     style is used for all the text; simple and formal, which is
                     adequately suited for its instructional purpose.

                     This image clearly demonstrates the application of repetition
                     in color scheme and font consistency to create emphasis.

                     is slightly of black actionable engagement boxes alternate based on

                     links and exercises, all other engagement boxes being grey).
                     All engagement boxes are white text on a solid color while main body 
                     information text is typically gray.  Navigational links on the left
                     are black and those in the nav bar are white on green.

                  W3schools does a great job of implementing the Typography principle into
